# R6RS Scheme Lisp dialect interpreter

This is an implementation of a subset of R6RS Scheme Lisp dialect in golang.

The work is still in progress.

At the moment, only the parser is implemented.

Sometimes I do live streaming of the development process on ["\[RU\] \*nixtalks" Discord
server](https://discord.gg/dDPfD5SFDR).
